# Moist-Fluffy-Chocolate-Cake

Procedure:

1) Prepare to make the cake. Preheat the oven to 325° Fahrenheit or 162° Celsius. Grease and flour two   9-inch round baking pans.

2) Mix the dry ingredients. In a large bowl, combine the flour, salt, baking powder, baking soda, cocoa powder, and sugar. Mix until the dry ingredients are properly folded in.

3) Add the coffee, oil, and buttermilk. Pour in the hot coffee, canola oil, and buttermilk into the dry ingredients. Mix using a whisk or hand blender, until the ingredients resemble a light brown cake batter.

4) Add the eggs and vanilla. Crack in the eggs and pour in the vanilla extract into the cake batter. Mix one last time until there are no more flour streaks and the chocolate cake batter is slightly thick.

5) Pour batter into the cake pans. Using a rubber spatula, scrape the cake batter into both of the cake pans. Remove any leftover batter by scraping the edges of the bowl

6) Bake the cake. Place both cake pans in the oven to bake. Have the cake bake for about an hour, until the cake rises and is fluffy. Check to see if the cake is ready by sticking a small knife in the middle. If it comes out clean, it is fully baked.

7) Let the cake cool. Remove both pans from the oven and have the cakes cool on a wire rack for about ten minutes. Leave them until they are cool enough to touch.

8) Frost and decorate. Consider stacking both cakes to make a two-layer chocolate cake. Frost with chocolate buttercream frosting and/or decorate with any desired toppings such as berries, powdered sugar, coconut flakes, and sprinkles.

9) Serve and enjoy! Slice the chocolate cake and serve on a serving plate. Enjoy!
